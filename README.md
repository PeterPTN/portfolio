# Portfolio

This is my work portfolio which showcases the various projects I've deployed. Check it out here:

### Approach & Design Goals

Prior to this app, I had another portfolio made with ReactJS that was rather bloated and visually "loud" (portfolio-old repository). This here is my attempt at creating a relatively minimalistic portfolio that felt and looked light. I also made the decision to store all project data in a Firebase Firestore instead of saving files to the repository saving the need to edit the source code.
